# Radiohead Lyric Generator
A flask web app that takes the takes the lyrics of every Radiohead song and using markov chains, restructures those phrases into new sentences. If you don't want to use it as a straight up web app, just take the code from app.py for the markov chain generator and paste it into your own files. Jupyter tends to work the best for testing it out.

It's possible that the virtual enviornment won't work on your machine, although it should be fine if you're downloading from repo. Sorry in advance if you run into any problems.
